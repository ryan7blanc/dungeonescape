 About this project:
 This project consists of a game that progresses based on the user's input. At the start of the game, the user can buy
 objects and ingredients from the merchant, which will also decide how the game will progress. Once the user finishes shopping,
 they can move around the map, exploring different spaces and rooms on the map. When approaching a room or
 NPC character, you can fight a monster and gain extra materials. Based on the weapons and armor in your inventory, 
 you will either win or lose against the monster. With a total of 5 rooms, if you beat every monster in each room, you can fight the Sorcerer at the end.
